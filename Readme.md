## Description

<div align="center">
<strong>This project is in the process of becoming what will hopefully be a pretty slick portfolio site.</strong>
</div>

<p>
While studying web development, I started out with some tutorials and code-alongs, and then eventually moved onto creating my own projects. I have also done some freelance work for a couple small businesses. I still want to go back and polish off some of my older work, <i>but</i> I also want to continue learning new technologies and trades, possibly while collaborating with other developers or designers.

<p>
    As of writing this, my site is not yet finished! But thank you for taking the time to check out my repo :)

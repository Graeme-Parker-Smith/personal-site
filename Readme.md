## Description ##
**This project is in the process of becoming what will hopefully be a pretty slick portfolio site.**
<p>
While studying web development, I started out with some tutorials and code-alongs, and then eventually moved onto creating my own projects. I have also done some freelance work for a couple small businesses. I still want to go back and polish off some of my older work, _but_ I also want to continue learning new technologies and trades, possibly while collaborating with other developers or designers.

    As of writing this, my site is not yet finished! But thank you for taking the time to check out my repo :)
